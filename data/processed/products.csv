This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease. great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already... I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands. I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost. This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase. Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase. I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features! Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way! I love ordering books and reading them with the reader."

I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more I use to hate to read but now that I have my Kindle and I can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better I love to read. All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes. Great. Love it. I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more This thing has captured my wife's heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with. I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it's own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states. Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have"

Works good but, you can purchase a charger with same or better specs. on Amazon MUCH cheaper. I purchased a 5 port 30 watt charger for about 1/2 of the cost of this. Good products nice product great - can charge Kindle e-book reader without the need of computer being on. I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item. Works well. Excellent Product! I don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. I just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. It's probably the new Kindle's problem but I'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. I charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. So go ahead and buy this adapter good item this is way over priced"

I love this so much, I bought two! Also bought one for my parents. It is really easy to start up. Walks you right through the install process. I highly recommend. I love it. So easy to set up. Works with all my Amazon apps like Audible. Learning something new about it every day. Especially like using it for music. Totally happy with the item and purchase! Alexa has become a member of the family. She wakes us up in the morning, helps with math homework, plays music, and keeps track of our shopping lists! I can't imagine not having this device and the Dots in every room! Got this for the wife for x-mass does a lot of cool stuff she love it does every thing she wants and more This product makes life easier, smart home integration or just shopping lists... makes life easier. We are very much enjoying our Echo. Our grand children do too. Alexa answers all sorts of questions for us and we particularly enjoy the music we request. We have an app downloaded on our tablet so we can listen to podcasts and radio stations too. It's great! easy to be understood and the color is a nice arctic white We love Alexa and everything she can do for us and also the info for our son My husband loves his gift, I would recommend to al my family and i really love alexa, she works great and doubles as an assistant and a wireless speaker, I cant wait till she learns more commands"

I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own. highly recommend this product to all book lovers... I enjoy my kindle and would recommend to anyone. There is a good choice of books and reading material also. this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model."

Can't beat a tablet for $50 that actually works!!! I bought 3 of these for my kids, and they love it. They are cheap and affordable. Bought this tablet for a seven year old to use for YouTube videos and Netflix. It has been a good buy for this beginning tablet user. I really enjoy my Fire Tablet! I am able to read, watch videos, tv shows and much more! It is awesome for my little ones but it do not have youtube kids. Instead, you can pull up youtube kids on the regular part of the table, using the internet. That became a plus with my kids. I like how you can customize it to fit your child age! It has a lot of free games plus all of the books I read. It's awesome, I don't even use my phone as much h because I have my tablet. For the price it can't be beat. Just perfect, for my child who is only 9 years old We use it to control programmable robots Dash and Dot. A great low cost solution - would rather have kids beat up the kindle fire instead of an expensive iPad I like this tablet I'm very impressed with it I didn't expect it to do too much but my goddaughter has the same tablet and I thought I'd purchase it for my two-year-old just to keep her busy when mommy has business to handle and it does a pretty good job. I have this tablet and liked it so much I purchased another as a gift. It was easy to set up and use. She loved it. Great if you just want to read and occasionally browse the web. Great value!"

Fast fun tablet with great speakers compared to previous fire tablet. Worth the money Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps. I have always had a kindle fire but I had one that was just overloaded with books and so I bought a new one with more memory. It is awesome and so fast. But also the battery charges very fast and hold a charge for a very long time. Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better. meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad. Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!! Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids. My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!! I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery."

Alexa is the greatest product ever I use it around the house all of the time I love my Alexa! Much simpler to set up than I expected, she was connected to my WiFi in under 3 minutes. She's yet failed to understand my request. Our next step is to get Ethernet-controlled outlets for lights, etc., so that Alexa can control those for us. This is such a neat gadget.my daughter absolutely loves it! Still learning all the things it can do but solo it is a nice quick answer system and music player. I now have mine hooked to HUE lights, Honeywell Thermostat, and a Belkin outlet with a heater. Nice to have Alexa turn on my kitchen lights when I'm running in groceries. Purchased this on cyber Monday and it was worth it. Alexa is my new best friend. Alexa is great for keeping shopping lists,controllong my wemo switches and playing music. As good as Siri for trivia, but they still both have a way to go to become less frustrating. Liked product so much we purchased the dot for upstairs and it works equally as well. After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only). I actually didn't think I'll be using the Amazon Echo as much as I do when I decided to buy it. It's definitely become a something that's called on for everyday purposes from playing music to checking traffic. I don't really have any complaints except for that the Echo doesn't hear me use its wake word so I feel like I'm screaming at it before it takes action. Overall, very satisfied. Amazon Echo is easy to use and provides a fun aspect to its application. Am looking forward to expanding to its use with home smart devices. Only downside is with a grandchild named Alexis, not being able to rename is a bit problematic. Was given as a gift and Husband extremely pleased with the purchase."

This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone! I previously had a first edition paper white and finally pulled the trigger on a voyage. I'm so glad I did, the resolution is great and it seems easier to read. I also like that the screen is completely flat. I don't really use the page turn buttons like I thought i would but it is nice to have the option. I have several generations of Kindle readers, and this is far and away the best. It is relatively expensive, but the features are worth it. Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun... bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it Bought two for gifts. A huge hit!! They are readers and love not having to lug books. I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The ""squeeze the edge"" for a page turn is what sold me. I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect!

Really enjoy my echo. Great sound fun to use and stylist I'm using the Echo and Samsung's hub as the centerpieces of my home automation system. Since buying the Echo I've also added several Dots to build out the system. It's a lot of fun to work with. This is one cool item. It doesn't take up a lot of space, has a great sound and is like having a personal assistant. Like using it to play music, answering questions, playing favorite radio stations, setting timers in kitchen, telling jokes. Apps for games are few. Questions to Alexa must be exactly worded or she does not understand the question. i adore my echo...i wake up in morning, get a quick weather, sports scores...and here in florida, i get to listen to my favorite nyc sports radio stations...i use it to access my music...and i recently purchased a audio book for the wife, and i am waiting until i give her that audiobook for xmas; the i can ask alexa to read it to me ! ... i am sure alexa does so much more...(i even asked it to convert to metric for me when i was cooking last week)...i do not have any smart devices in my house, so i havent had the opportunity to have alexa do that for me...but it is so much fun to use...and now, instead if reaching for laptop to google something...i just ask alexa first The echo is great. It can run smart home products and play music. I pick it for one feature but it does so much more. I rave about it to everyone Alexa speaks clearly and gives comprehensive answers to questions asked of it. Having weather, sports and news on voice demand without having to type a request is terrific. I like this speaker.great product from Amazon.all what I need alexa is a great gift have given to family and friends always a great feedback"

My family really enjoys the Amazon Echo. We have it set up to automate our home and remind us of things that are in our schedules. We picked up the Echo and two of the Echo Dots. We love to play our music and control our television by just simply telling it to do so. Locate your phone with one of the skills. I purchased one for my mother so she can use My Buddy if she gets hurt and call for someone if she can't get to her phone. There is a lot of potential for development in home automation as well as the connected automobile. Got it for the sole purpose of controlling my home lighting. Works perfect! Family is having fun using ECHO. We use it as an alarm, for time, music, weather and getting answers to some of our questions. The sound is good, and it gets really loud. New features are always added, and it is compatible with a growing list of products. *The less awesome part: I've found that if I go to max volume, Alexa can't hear me even if I scream right next to her. Set up was easy. Alexa so far has been on target and extremely helpful. Love the echo. Great for listening to music and quick information"

A bit pricey, but worth the money in my opinion. Perfect size and great screen! I am very please with my Kindle Voyage. The size is perfect and the control lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone. Reading on the voyage is such a pleasure. Its so much more convenient than carrying around an actual book. I love that I can read in bed without disturbing my partner. The backlight makes reading a pleasure whether in the dark or outside in the sun. Truly well worth the price if you are a serious reader. I love having several books available so I never run out of reading material while at the doctors or on a plane...... Great for reading any book, light weight, easy to use best Kindle on the market. Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted. I love to read and using the Kindle has been great. The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use. Fantastic for reading in dark conditions. Very light and easy to hold. I purchased this Kindle because I wanted the buttons on the side -- I prefer to hold my e-reader in just my left hand and it's hard to turn pages by screen press only. I love this so far! It's an upgrade from my Nook because it's so much easier to borrow books from the library! I've never used a Paperwhite so I can't speak as to how it's better, other than it has the side-press buttons (which was worth it to me). I love the size and the well-lit screen. The words appear very crisp and easy to read!!!"

The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. Can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. Slim and lightweight when not using a case which I appreciate most about this kindle. Makes for easy holding and carrying/packing. Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up. We can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. This is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go. I would give it 4.5 if that was an option. I love my kindle voyage. It is very little weight and I love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. You can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with. Love my Kindle! I take it with me everywhere! I would recommend this to all my friends and family! Kindle voyage is the costliest of the kindle range but its worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight. Enjoying it so far. Hands down this is the best ereader that you can buy... When you compare the Kindle Voyage 6's Screen to the other model. The Screen was brighter for reading"

Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, i use it in place of a speaker and connect my phone to it. Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, the fact that's it Bluetooth is awesome. Speaker quality is better than expected, works well in the living room, convenient addition Excellent product. It's well worth the money. I have my system linked to my Iris Security System This is our 2nd Amazon Echo already. We got the black in in our living room & this on outlr master's bedroom. They are amazing products! This is my 2nd Echo, and I also have two of the smaller Dots. Amazon has now enabled multi-room music playing, with all your speakers that you've designated perfectly synced with each other. It also serves as a good quality Bluetooth speaker so you can use it with any other app on your device for sound. I also use it to control my connected lights and can even operate my entertainment system through a logitech hub. And, the voice assistant Alexa is just getting smarter and smarter with every passing month. Get it on sale when it's under 100 dollars and it makes one of the most useful electronics purchases you could make! I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker to use to play Amazon Music, and this product allows to to listen to music and do so much more. If you have an Amazon Prime account you'll enjoy this product. This is my fourth Echo device and me and my family are loving it. We use it many times in a day for various things like weather, time, controlling lights and other appliances. New feature of Music grouping makes it even better for filling your entire house with music. Now a device that is expandable and everyone in the house can use it. Works smooth. I am going to expand additional devices with this now. The Echo does everything it is advertised to do. Mine does things without a hitch that others have a problem with. Mine does lighting through my alarm system in a few simple steps. Works great!"

Alexa is very good a quickly satisfying your music requests. The whole interface is novel and interesting to use and for guests who have not encountered Alexa previously. Sound quality is good but not top shelf. I purchased one for our son and son-in-law for Fathers Day. Finally about 3 weeks ago we bought one for ourselves. Net: worth purchasing. Really enjoy our day to day interactions with Alexa Good speaker but limited if you don't have a big music collection. I wish it did more Easy to use and very fun!! Use it for my PC speaker and it's awesome!!"

Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all. What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time."

Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more"

I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!"

Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in. As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips! Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought. Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy... Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me. Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet. Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me. Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."

The best value for the money hands down. Works perfectly. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it and the games I have bought several Kindle Fire's over the years. I think they are great for streaming movies & videos. You can downloaded movies on the device and use it while off wi-fi. Decent....................................................................... I actually bought this for a friend. I already have one. She loves to read and I thought this would be perfect for her to download books on. She absolutely loves it for that plus all the other features she can do on her tablet. Such a great buy! Small amd neat. Everything you need on this little device. It's nice and simple. Easy to carry around. If you have children its not bad when traveling The Fire tablet is such a great value. If money is no consideration, there are better tablets out there, but for the money, this is a great choice, especially if you're a Prime member. we bought this amazon tablet because my 3 year received one as a gift for her aunt. My 2 year was using an iPad but kept dropping it. This is great because it's small enough for him to hold and if you buy the case it's completely protected. The only issue we seem to have is that the power cord is really loose when you plug it in to charge so sometimes it does not get charged. That is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I brought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my 9yr old son. It is the only present that he is still to this day playing with he loves his tablet."

This is my third kindle and is the best by far. The smaller size is great because it fits nicely in my purse so I never leave home without it. Other great features are page turning, adjusting light and weight. This item was a replacement for a misplaced/lost Kindle Voyage. It is my go-to eReader, compact, light-weight, and read anywhere (bright sun, shade, at nite) device. The Kindle Paperwhite could have been equally useful, but I was spoiled with the Voyage. As a note, I also have an iPadMini and an iPad Air2, but they are much heavier to lug around. This E-reader makes reading ebooks very easy on the eyes and provides for a beautiful experience. The product feels like quality but gathers finger print marks on the back quickly if it doesn't have a case. Overall the e-reading experience is excellent though as the lighting and colors come across very pleasantly. Lightweight, easy on the eyes, easy to use, many wonderful features"

Although this won't be competing with the iPad or some higher end android tablets, this easily outperforms any other tablet in this price range. I also love the fact that, although this is made of plastic, it has a unibody design and great build quality; not flimsy like many other tablets at this price. It meet my expectations. It performs well compared to other tables. I am very satisfied with the product and it quality. Lastly, it worth the price I paid for. Very satisfied with this purchase. Fast, big screen and good resolution. Bought it for my son around Xmas and I got a very good deal too! Wish I had bought 2 at that price. ($100) I love everything about the kindle fire but i would like a bigger screen Could not download apps I needed to control my tvs Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option This newest version of Fire works great! Responds fast to opening apps and speed of browser is quick. The color choices are nice too! Full disclosure, I've only had iPads in the past. I needed an android based tablet as a 3rd party app that I needed was yet IOS supported. You get what you pay for. Build quality, touch and feel, yes it's equal to the price. Constant adds urging you to make various Amazon based purchases...not my cup of tea but I guess fills a price point and need. Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly. This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on."

Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants. When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing! Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price. A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it. It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle. this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features. Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well. Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!! Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"

The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better. Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great. This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs. This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself. First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition. For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that. I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Fire - First Edition. This one is really nice. Graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. I don't know, yet, what else it can do as I haven't explored it thoroughly. It's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet. Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16GB has been easy for me to learn how to use. I like that I can read free books from the library. It has everything I wanted and is a nice size for holding."

I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact. Love the feel of it and love the page turn buttton. My husband loves this. They battery life is aweseome. Nice to take when traveling! Easy to carry; easy to read. Easy to get books and download. Nice to have a dictionary within your book. Able to download books, newspapers or magazines. The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage. This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight. Good replacement for a paperwhite. The addition of the page forward and page backward buttons is huge! I upgraded from the Kindle Touch so I could have a built in light. The light is fantastic. While it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, I love that too. Can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. The documentation could use some work. A diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. Took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what I wanted. One thing, I HATE the new bookmark method. The old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. Still can figure out how to delete from My Clippings. Also I wish Amazon would come out with a case similar to an Otter Box. I don't want leather OR auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case I look at. Bought this as a Christmas gift. My daughter loves it. She specifically likes the screen lighting. Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would."

The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again Great product and service and the sales man r really nice. Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good very good product and service will refer a friend. Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times. This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily. Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great. It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better! Very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead."

Purchased the Echo as a bridal shower gift. My niece and her fianc are still learning about all it can do but already reported back to me that they love it. I was told it is the most favorite gift they received. Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry. We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa. I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet. The Amazon Echo has very good voice recognition. It works just as advertised and is quick with the responses. I was glad to see it at best buy so I could touch it and try it before I bought it. The setup was easy and quick. This thing does so many things it's incredible. Time saver, information finder , and even a family entertainer! We love this product, and are having so much fun with it. I can make a shopping list with it, get news, weather forecast , play our favorite music and so many other things that I have yet to discover. Very versatile device that is constantly updated by Amazon. Price is very fair for this product. Welcome to our home Alexa! She makes a great addition to our home. I would highly recommend this device."

I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle. ReallyRead more The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job.

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to.

Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts.Read more I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more The Kindle is my first e-ink reader.

A nice size with many perks, like a crisp screen & fun vibrant colored outer shell. However the pop up ads are annoying. I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment! Good product with great value. Recommend this to all. I really like the easy setup and the parental cobtrols.. its easy to download games and my daughter loves it I like this tablet a lot. The size is good. The screen is good. It functions well. This is my second fire tablet. I really like that it automatically installs (syncs) apps from my first tablet at start up. Very convenient. The price was very good. Ordered on line with same day pick up at the local best buy. SWEET! Great tablet, only thing I would add would be a camera. My daughter loves it!"

Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life. I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it. This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt. The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea. Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product. I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point. I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite! Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."

I purchased this for my son overseas as he had broken the screen on his last one. When he opened it he was amazed at the size and weight of this one. He also was very elated that all his books that he purchased immediately downloaded to the new one with his bookmarks in place. All in all a great purchase from an excellent company. Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features. Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light. Always great to upgrade new from old version when the staff is always knowledgeable Love this ereader; very convenient. Very easy to use. This is the best Kindle yet and I am loving it! For someone who suffers from eye strain but loves to read, the 300 dpi image resolution and the liquid ink technology are beyond compare. Buy it, you won't regret it!! Bought this reader for a present for my mom. She loves it. Able to take her book with her in a smaller form loves how it looks like paper pages. Easy to order a new book. This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear. I like this Kindle, but I am not sure it is worth the premium over the Paperwhite. I previously had a Kindle Fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. But it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it. I had been reading on my iPad mini most of the time, but around the pool or at the beach, that was almost impossible. The Voyage is great not only in bright sunshine but inside, even in a pretty dark room. The back light is great for just about any environment. The battery life is fantastic."

This is my 2 nd kindle. I bought this because of the lighting option. It is great product, but I think little bit over priced. It runs perfectly for my need. Weight is perfect.Size is right. It fits anywhereView is sharp, day or night This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance. This is great for reading, it's light and easy to read. I love it. I love the new kindle. I have a third generation and the new features are awesome. I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading. My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously This is a great reader. As a tablet it will not replace my iPad I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!"

Much better than my original Kindle. Lighter and easier to read. The old Kindle served me well and I won't retire it but it;s newer version is good. The amazon reader is everything I dreamed it would be. I can read in the dark. It helps me get to sleep sooner, because the light is not as bright. My love of reading has only increased! ! A great purchase no doubt about that! ! I bought this before I went on vacation to Florida and it was great for reading in the sun! A bit complicated the process of loading Books bought in different stores to Amazon. It should be more user friendly for new users (we do not come from amazon) very thin and portable.. If i've read more i would use it Kindle paper white is a fantastic e-reader. It has great contrast, is easy on the eyes, and the backlight is just right for reading in darker environments. My first kindle paperwhite lasted several years, and I used it a lot! When it quit, I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased another one. After only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. I could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. I went back to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a new one. If it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. I thought the Kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. This time, I bought the insurance plan. Best Buy treated me great. There was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund. Even though I did not have my original receipt, only had my charge card bill, there was not a problem. Everyone in the family now owned one.Works well and easy to read in the sun Although I really like having a physical book to hold onto, I really like being able to travel with this and not have the bulk of several real books. It also make borrowing books from my local library really easy. Delivers on all counts. Lets me read anywhere I want and download easily from my local library digitally!"

Just love it. Easy to set up and use. Tons of information and jokes. Plays all my music and give spots scores. So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released This is my new favorite device. While not perfect, it's a lot of un to use.One of the features I like the best is the timer functions. I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero. The best part is that, through IFTT, I can trigger Alexa to call my phone, or send a notification, if I'm not in the same room as she is. I do the same for when I'm doing laundry. I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house. Through the Skills for each of these companies, the Echo found all the devices, and I'm not able to control all of them using my voice. Really great device to own and play around with. I got this to basically experiment with. Straight out of the box, it's really not that impressive. It's a ""novelty"", however, as I checked out the skills available, lights started coming on - Literally! Echo's ability to integrate with Home Automation is excellent! Having voice commands for turning on/off lights may seem like a novelty as well, however, there are endless options for the elderly, or disabled with this little assistant, and some customizing. Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked ""Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?"" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come. This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI."

Doesn't always do what I asked for. It is probably because my voice wasn't as clear as it could be. I absolutely love this devise. I do wish ti was more compatible with more things, but it is still well worth it!! Absolutely love this thing! It controls my lights and works as a fantastic alarm clock. This thing has plenty of awesome features. It's basically Jarvis in my house I bought this echo when it was first released and I just couldn't swallow the cost. It's a cool speaker that allowed hands free operation but $100 was just too much money. Since then, the discounts have been much more meager but it's become so useful. I've smartened up my home and controlling my lights, entertainment system and security system has been amazing. The Amazon Echo is super easy to set up. Once set up, it's actually fun to see what Alexa would say to any and all of your questions. What's great is that even if there is background noise or other people talking at the same time, Alexa can still hear you and will respond accordingly. My family and i love it,its now a member of our family. I was very skeptical at first with this, but Alexa has become part of my everyday use very quickly. Whenever I get home from work, or I need to do chores around the house, ""Alexa, open Pandora."" Its super convenient and the speakers on it are amazing. I'm really impressed. If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so. More than 10 feet away, Alexa won't hear me. Other than that though, this thing is awesome. I'm glad I got it. From news, to music, to the weather and much more. The amazon echo makes mornings and showers a lot more fun! The voice recognition is best I've ever seen. Alexa can hear me from my bedroom while its stationed in the living room. I love just being able to wake up in the morning and telling Alexa to play my music. So simple and amazing. That's just a beginning of what it will do. Ask anything, most of the time it's answered. Just awesome. Originally figured this would be almost a toy, but as I easily started connecting the Echo to my existing home automation components I realized this would become a key part of my home. Throw in the different connections the Echo can make (with my car, for example) and you now have an essential component to your day...absolutely worth it!"
